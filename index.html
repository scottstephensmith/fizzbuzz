	<h1>Simple Fizz Buzz Calculations</h1>
	<p>This is all done using a "for" loop function and a couple if/else statements to check modulo values.</p>
	<p>Numbers divisible by 3 render as "fizz", those divisible by 5 render as "buzz", and those divisible by both render as "fizzbuzz"</p>
	<p>It will count up from 1 to whatever positive integer value you input.</p>
